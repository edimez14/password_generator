# Password Generator web version

When you enter the website, you will find a message that will tell you the things you can do on the website.
The framework I used to create the password generator web page is called reflex dev.

You can see that there is also a theme change button, where you can change from light to dark or from dark to light.

When you press the generate password button, the website will show a randomly generated password, and every time you click the button, it will generate a new password different from the previous one.

You can generate the number of passwords you prefer, there is no limit.
